X-Universe Fleet Fest
=====================

Extract the contents (director and scripts) of the xff.zip file to your game
directory. Download and set up the game maps from the XFF topic on the Egosoft
forum.

The Director script is set up so you can paste in the fleets from different
battles to test out. If agreed upon it can replace the current fight-making
script being used now.

The file "battlecode.txt" contains fleet matchups. Just copy the groups of code
to the "xff.director.fightmaker.xml" file. The upper group goes within the
Argon section and the lower group to the Xenon section. Start up in the custom
map and enjoy the battle!
